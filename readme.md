**WARNING: 

I am a novice in application developement, this is the first time in years I try to get some project from zero, I've mostly done basic wordpress theme adjustments (at least in code ;)) and basic plugins, this is also the first time I use a php framework!**

# 99percent

Volunteer projects are time consuming, always. They always lack of helping hands, too. Some miss discussions where only on man/woman is controlling and deciding everything and whenever she or he is gone (maybe finished with studies, a change in worklife) everything falls into pieces. Volunteer projects are part of a sharing economy that I'd like to have in more everyday aspects thats what I want to start 99percent (working title, might change whenever something good comes up)

## Event Organizing: Project/Shift/Task Planning

Basic idea is to have an interface for (self-)organizing events/projects with related tasks, ressources (eg. audio technology), shifts and results, this should be able to spread across various organizations should include qualifications that are needed for shifts/projects, etc.

## Influencing Audience: Newsletter/Call For Members/Fundraising (future!)

Creating alternative influencing methods is absolutely necessary for the countryside, scene building processes or promoting involvement of fans and friends. So this is all about information, creating transparency, finding a way to show where money (roughly) comes from, where its going... not yet outlined. 


## Idea Management Crowd Involvement / Gain Members (future!)

By letting the crowd/audience/guests/friends make suggestions in what they are missing and giving them the opportunity to discuss, they can actively help in growing into the organization and with some support will soon be able to create their own projects from scratch. Also they will see the fun that lays in doing the technician for a band, or working at the entrance/at a bar.

Other people should be able to vote these ideas and with some criteria it will go into the next phase where financial criterias and responsible people will be cleared. After that -> Event Organizing

## Statistics (future!)

Identify the most hard-working people, the projects that had the most guests, cost the most money, the big-hearted sponsor... everything for the yearly roundup.

## Bookkeeping (never ever, very far future!)

Deliver a chance to send in recipes online and make project accounting faster+easier... to be outlined
